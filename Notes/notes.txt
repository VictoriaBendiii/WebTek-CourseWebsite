Server-Side Web Scripting
    
    Java Servlet
        - Objects that are intended to play the role of server components in the client-server communication and is dynamic to Web Applications.
        - It handles client requests. It extends the capabilities of a server.
	- History
		- The Servlet1 specification was created by Pavni Diwanji and was finalized by June 1997.
		- James Gosling first thought of servlets in the early days of Java, but the concept did not become a product until Sun shipped the Java Web Server product
		- This was before what is now the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition was made into a specification.

        - JAVA EE 7
        
        Packages: 
            javax.servlet.Servlet
            javax.servlet.GenericServlet
            javax.servlet.http.httpServlet
              
        
        Life Cycle:
            Initialization => init()
            Request Handling => service()
            doGet()
            doPost()
            Destruction => destroy()

    HTTP Servlet (Javaw.servlet.http)
        - Used to handle HTTP Requests & generate HTTP responses
        - Hosted in a Web Container

    HTTP Servlet Response
        - It is generated by the servlet & sent back to the requesting client
 
Php 
    - Stands for Hypertext Preprocessor
    - A server-side scripting language, which offers features that allow us to make dynamic and interactive web pages.
    - is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that can interact with a database. 
    - It can be integrated with a number of popular databases like MySQL.
	HISTORY
	- it started out just as a small source project that developed as to people discovered it and
	  used it more often. 
	- In 1994, Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP.
    - In order to run a PHP Web page, it needs three components; A Web Server, Database and a PHP parser.
    - PHP can perform system functions such as create, open, read and write on a database.
    - It also can handle forms for example gathering of data and saving data into a file.       
    - Identified with delimiting tag "<?php  *code*  ?>"
    - 8 Data types in PHP:
        - boolean
        - integer
        - float
        - string
        - array

        echo
        print()
        printf()
        
    - Conditional statements
        < > = != ! && ||
    
Session Handling    
    - A session is a technique used to store data from users to be used for future activities of the user within the Web Application.
    - with the $_SESSION variable, Session handling is possible with PHP.
    
    - Important functions in Session handling:
        - session_start()
        - isset() - Validation if the current session is running actively or not.
        - unset() - to destroy the session.
